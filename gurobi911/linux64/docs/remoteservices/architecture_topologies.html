<P>
Let us now review a few common deployment configurations.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cluster Manager with a single node</SPAN>

<P>
In this deployment, we only need to deploy one instance of a
Cluster Manager with the Database and a single Compute Server node.
This is appropriate for small environments so that you
can offload simple optimization tasks to one Compute Server.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cluster Manager with multiple nodes</SPAN>

<P>
If you need to handle more jobs concurrently, you will need to add
more Compute Server nodes. Also, if you want to run distributed
algorithms, several Distributed Worker nodes will be needed. To this
end, you can deploy one instance of the Cluster Manager (with a
Database), and connect those nodes to the Cluster Manager.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Scalable Cluster Manager</SPAN>

<P>
If you have even more concurrent users, or if you need a scalable and
high available architecture, several instances of the Cluster Manager
can be started. In this case, you may need to install and set up a
regular HTTP load balancer (such as <code>Nginx</code>) in front of the
Cluster Manager instances. Cluster Manager server instances are
stateless and can be scaled up or down.

<P>
The database itself, as supported by MongoDB, can be deployed in a
cluster.  In a MongoDB cluster, one of the nodes is chosen dynamically
as the primary, while the others are deemed secondary.  Secondary nodes
replicate the data from the primary node.  In the event of a failure
of the primary node, the Cluster Manager will choose a new primary
node and continue to operate.

<P>
In this deployment, several Compute Server nodes are also recommended.
In the event of a node failure, any jobs currently running on the
failed node will fail, but new jobs will continue to be processed
on the remaining nodes.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Self-Managed Cluster</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:SelfManagedCluster"></A>
<P>
Finally, Compute Server nodes and Distributed Worker nodes can be
deployed by themselves, without a Cluster Manager or a Database.  This
was actually the only option in Gurobi version 8 and earlier.  In this
configuration, you will not benefit from the latest features: secured
access using user accounts and API keys, persistent job history, batch
management, and the Web User Interface.
