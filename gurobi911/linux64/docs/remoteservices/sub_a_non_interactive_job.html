Submitting a Non-Interactive Job
</H3>

<P>
You can use <TT>grbcluster</TT> to create a batch (i.e., a
non-interactive job):

<P>

<PRE>
&gt; grbcluster batch solve ResultFile=solution.sol misc07.mps --download
info  : Batch 5d0ea600-5068-4a0b-bee0-efa26c18f35b created
info  : Uploading misc07.mps...
info  : Batch 5d0ea600-5068-4a0b-bee0-efa26c18f35b submitted with job a9700b72...
info  : Batch 5d0ea600-5068-4a0b-bee0-efa26c18f35b status is COMPLETED
info  : Results will be stored in directory 5d0ea600-5068-4a0b-bee0-efa26c18f35b
info  : Downloading solution.sol...
info  : Downloading gurobi.log...
info  : Discarding batch data
</PRE>

<P>
This command performs a number of steps.  First, a batch specification
is created and the batch ID is displayed. Then, the model file is
uploaded and a batch job is submitted.  Once the job reaches the front
of the Compute Server queue, it is processed.  At that point, the
batch is marked as completed and the result file with the log file is
automatically downloaded to the client. By default, the directory name
where the result file is stored is the batch ID.  Finally, the batch
data is discarded, which allows the Cluster Manager to delete the
associated data from its database.

<P>
This is a non-interactive optimization task because it happens in two
distinct phases.  The first phase uploads the model to the server and
creates a batch.  The second waits for the batch to complete and
retrieves the result.  In general, stopping the client has no effect
on a batch once it has been submitted to the Cluster Manager. Our
example waits for the completion of the batch, but that's only because
we used the <TT>--download</TT> flag.  You could check on
the status of the batch and download the results whenever (and
wherever) they are needed, since they are stored in the Cluster
Manager until they are discarded.
