Configuring a Cluster Node
</H3>

<P>
The Remote Services agent has a number of configuration properties
that affect its behavior.  These can be controlled using a <TT>  grb_rs.cnf</TT> configuration file.  The installation package includes
a predefined configuration file that can be used as a starting point
(<TT>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/grb_rs.cnf</TT>).

<P>
The simplest way to modify the parameters is to edit the default
configuration file.  Other options are available, though.  The
<TT>grb_rs</TT> process uses the following precedence rules:

<UL>
<LI>First priority: command-line flag <TT>--config</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Second priority: a configuration file in the current directory
</LI>
<LI>Third priority: a configuration file in a shared directory (<TT>C:&#92;gurobi</TT>, <TT>/opt/gurobi</TT>, <TT>/Library/gurobi</TT> for Windows, Linux and Mac OS platforms, respectively)
</LI>
<LI>Fourth priority: a configuration file in the directory where <TT>grb_rs</TT> is located
</LI>
</UL>
Most of the properties that are configured through this file are
related to communication options and job processing options.
The configuration file is only read once, when <TT>grb_rs</TT> first
starts.  Subsequent changes to the file won't affect parameter values
on a running server.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Configuration file format</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
The configuration file contains a list of properties of the form
<TT>PROPERTY=value</TT>.  Lines that begin with the # symbol are
treated as comments and are ignored.  Here is an example:

<PRE>
# grb_rs.cnf configuration file
PORT=61000
MANAGER=http://mymanager:61080
</PRE>
While you could create this file from scratch, we recommend you start
with the version of this file that is included with the product and
modify it instead.

<P>
The command <TT>grb_rs properties</TT> lists all of
the available properties, their default values, and provides
documentation for each.  Some can be overridden on the
command-line of <TT>grb_rs</TT>; the name of the command-line flag you
would use to do so is provided as well.
Some properties are important and must be changed for a production deployment.
However, we need to distinguish between deployment with a Cluster Manager and
without.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Important Properties with a Cluster Manager</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
When deploying a node with a Cluster Manager, the configuration is easier
and you need to review the following properties:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>MANAGER</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the URL of the manager.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>HOSTNAME</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This must be the DNS name of the node that can be resolved
from the other nodes or from the Cluster Manager.  <TT>grb_rs</TT> tries to get a reasonable
default value, but this value may still not be resolved by other nodes and could
generate connection errors.  It this case, you need to override this name in the configuration
file with a fully qualified name of your node, for example:

<PRE>
HOSTNAME=server1
</PRE>
Note that you do not need to give addresses that can be resolved by clients
because all communication is routed through the Cluster Manager. The nodes
are never accessed directly by the clients.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CLUSTER_TOKEN</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The token is a private key that enables different
  nodes to join the same cluster.  All nodes of a cluster and the Cluster Manager must have
  the same token.  We recommended that you generate a brand new token
  when you set up your cluster.  The <TT>grb_rs token</TT> command
  will generate a random token, which you can copy into
  the configuration file.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>JOBLIMIT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This property sets the maximum number of jobs that
  can run concurrently when using Compute Server on a specific node.
  The limit can be
  changed on a running cluster using the <TT>grbcluster node config</TT>
  command, in which case the new value will persist and the value in
  the configuration file will be ignored from that point on (even
  if you stop and restart the cluster).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>HARDJOBLIMIT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Certain jobs (those with priority 100) are allowed
  to ignore the JOBLIMIT, but they aren't allowed to ignore this limit.
  Client requests beyond this limit are queued. This limit is set to 0
  by default which means that it is disabled.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Important Properties without a Cluster Manager</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
When installing a node that will not be connected to a Cluster Manager, authentication
of clients uses predefined passwords that must be stored in the
configuration file.  The default configuration files must be
reviewed and the following properties must be changed for a production deployment:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>HOSTNAME</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This must be the DNS name of the node that can be resolved
from the other nodes or the clients in your network. <TT>grb_rs</TT> tries to get a reasonable
default value, but this value may still not be resolved by clients and could
generate connection errors. It this case, you need to override this name in the configuration
file with a fully qualified name of your node, for example:

<PRE>
HOSTNAME=server1
</PRE>
If the names cannot be resolved by clients, another option is to use IP addresses directly,
in this case set this property to the IP address of the node.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CLUSTER_TOKEN</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The token is a private key that enables different
  nodes to join the same cluster.  All nodes of a cluster must have
  the same token.  We recommended that you generate a brand new token
  when you set up your cluster.  The <TT>grb_rs token</TT> command
  will generate a random token, which you can copy into
  the configuration file.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>PASSWORD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the password that clients must supply in order
  to access the cluster.  It can be stored in clear text or hashed.
  We recommended that you create your own password, and that you
  store it in hashed form.  You can use the <TT>grb_rs hash</TT> command
  to compute the hashed value for your chosen password.

<PRE>
grb_rs hash newpass
$$ppEieKZExlBR-pCSUMlmc4oWlG8nZsUOE2IM0hJbzsmV_Yjj
</PRE>
Then copy and paste the value in the configuration file:

<PRE>
PASSWORD=$$ppEieKZExlBR-pCSUMlmc4oWlG8nZsUOE2IM0hJbzsmV_Yjj
</PRE>

<P>
The default password is <TT>pass</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ADMINPASSWORD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the password that clients must supply in
  order to run restricted administrative job commands.  It can be
  stored in clear text or hashed.  We recommended that you create your
  own password, and that you store it in hashed form.  You can use the
  <TT>grb_rs hash</TT> command to compute the hashed value for your
  chosen password.  The default password is <TT>admin</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CLUSTER_ADMINPASSWORD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the password that clients must
  supply in order to run restricted administrative cluster commands.
  It can be stored in clear text or hashed.  We recommended that you
  create your own password, and that you store it in hashed form.  You
  can use the <TT>grb_rs hash</TT> command to compute the hashed value
  for your chosen password.  The default password is <TT>cluster</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>JOBLIMIT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This property sets the maximum number of jobs that
  can run concurrently when using Compute Server on a specific node.
  The limit can be
  changed on a running cluster using the <TT>grbcluster node config</TT>
  command, in which case the new value will persist and the value in
  the configuration file will be ignored from that point on (even
  if you stop and restart the cluster).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>HARDJOBLIMIT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Certain jobs (those with priority 100) are allowed
  to ignore the JOBLIMIT, but they aren't allowed to ignore this limit.
  Client requests beyond this limit are queued. This limit is set to 0
  by default which means that it is disabled.
