Architecture
</H2>

<P>
Let us now consider the roles of the different Remote Services
components.  Consider a Remote Services deployment:
<DIV class="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphics/csgraphics/csmanager_multiple}}$
 -->
<IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img7.svg"
 ALT="\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[width=6in]{graphics/csgraphics/csmanager_multiple}}">
</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV>
The deployment may consist of five distinct components:
the <A HREF="client_api.html#sec:ClientAPI">Clients</A>,
the <A HREF="#sec:ComponentsClusterManager">Cluster Manager</A>,
the <A HREF="#sec:ComponentsDatabase">Database</A>,
the <A HREF="#sec:ComponentsComputeServer">Compute Server nodes</A>,
and the
<A HREF="#sec:ComponentsDistributedWorker">Distributed Worker nodes</A>.
Several of these are optional, and a few can be replicated for high
availability.  This gives a variety of topology options, which
we'll discuss
<A HREF="architecture_topologies.html#sec:ArchitectureTopologies">shortly</A>.
First, let us consider the components individually.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cluster Manager</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:ComponentsClusterManager"></A>
<P>
The Cluster Manager is the central component of the architecture.
It provides the following functions:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Security.</B> The Cluster Manager is in charge of
  authenticating and authorizing all access to the cluster.  It does
  this by managing user accounts and API keys, and by controlling
  access to all Remote Services nodes (Compute Servers or Distributed
  Workers).

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Cluster Monitoring.</B> The Cluster Manager gives
   visibility to all operations on the cluster: available nodes,
   licenses, and jobs. It also records and retains job history,
   including detailed metadata and engine logs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Batch Management.</B> The Cluster Manager controls the
   batch creation process and the storage of input models and output
   solutions.  It also keeps a history of batches. Internally, it
   communicates with the nodes to submit and monitor batch jobs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>REST API.</B> All of the functions provided by the Cluster
   Manager are exposed in a REST API. This REST API is used by all
   built-in clients: <TT>gurobi_cl</TT>, <TT>grbtune</TT>,
   <TT>grbcluster</TT>, and the Web User Interface.  The REST API
   can also be used by user programs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Web User Interface.</B> The Cluster Manager includes a Web
   Application Server that provides a complete and secured Web User
   Interface to your Compute Server cluster.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The Cluster Manager is optional.  You can build a
<A HREF="architecture_topologies.html#sec:SelfManagedCluster">self-managed Remote Services cluster</A>,
but it will be missing many features.

<P>
Cluster Manager installation is covered
<A HREF="ins_a_cluster_manager.html#sec:RSMInstallManager">in this section</A>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Database</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:ComponentsDatabase"></A>
<P>
The database supports the Cluster Manager.  It stores a variety of
important information, including data with long lifespans, like user
accounts, API keys, history information for jobs and batches, and
data with shorter lifespans, like input models and their solutions
for batch optimization.

<P>
How much space does this database require?  This will depend primarily
on the expected sizes of input and output data for batches.  The
Cluster Manager will capture and store the complete model at the time
a batch is created, and it will store the solution once the model has
been solved.  These will be retained until they are discarded by the
user, or until they expire (the retention policy can be configured by
the Cluster Manager administrator).  The data is compressed, but it
can still be quite large.  To limit the total size of the database, we
suggest that you discard batches when you are done with them.  Note
that discarding a batch doesn't discard the associated (small)
metadata; that is kept in the cluster history.

<P>
The Cluster Manager uses MongoDB as its database - version 4.0 or
later.  Cluster Manager users must
<A HREF="ins_the_database.html#sec:RSMDatabase">install and configure their own database</A>
as part of the Compute Server installation process.  The
database can be run on-premise or remotely managed by a SaaS provider.
It can be deployed as a single node or as a cluster for high
availability.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Compute Server Node</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:ComponentsComputeServer"></A>
<P>
A Compute Server node is where optimization jobs are executed.
Each such node has a job limit that indicates how many jobs can be
executed on that node simultaneously.  The limit should reflect the
capacity of the machine and typical job characteristics.  Compute
Server nodes support advanced capabilities such as job queueing
and load-balancing.  Deploying a Compute Server requires a Gurobi
license.

<P>
Compute Server node installation is covered
<A HREF="ins_the_remote_services_pa.html#sec:RSMDownload">in this section</A>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Distributed Worker Node</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:ComponentsDistributedWorker"></A>
<P>
A Distributed Worker node can only be used as a worker
in a distributed algorithm.  Only one job can run on such a node at a
time and it does not support queueing or load balancing.  This type
of node does not require a Gurobi License.

<P>
Distributed Worker installation is covered
<A HREF="ins_the_remote_services_pa.html#sec:RSMDownload">in this section</A>.
