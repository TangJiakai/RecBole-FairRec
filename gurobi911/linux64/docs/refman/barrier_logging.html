Barrier Logging
</H2>

<P>
The barrier log can be divided into five sections: the presolve
section, the barrier preprocessing section, the barrier progress
section, the crossover progress section, and the summary section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Presolve Section</SPAN>

<P>
As mentioned earlier, the first thing the Gurobi optimizer does when
optimizing a model is to apply a <EM>presolve</EM> algorithm in order
to simplify the model.  The first section of the Gurobi log provides
information on the extent to which presolve succeeds in this effort.
Consider the following example output from NETLIB model <code>dfl001</code>:
<PRE>
Presolve removed 2349 rows and 3378 columns
Presolve time: 0.04s
Presolved: 3722 rows, 8852 columns, 30908 nonzeros
</PRE>
The example output shows that presolve was able to remove 2349 rows
and 3378 columns, and it required 0.04 seconds.  The final line in the
presolve section shows the size of the model after presolve.  This is
size of the model that is passed to the barrier optimizer.  Note that
the solution that is computed for this model is automatically
transformed into a solution for the original problem once barrier
finishes (in a process often called <EM>uncrushing</EM>), but this
uncrush step is transparent and produces no log output.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Barrier Preprocessing Section</SPAN>

<P>
The factor matrix for the linear system solved in each iteration of
the barrier method can be quite large and quite expensive to compute.
In order to reduce the cost of this computation, the first step of the
barrier algorithm is to compute a fill-reducing reordering of the rows
and columns of this matrix.  This step can be quite expensive, but the
cost is recouped in the reduced cost of the subsequent barrier
iterations.

<P>
Once this fill-reducing reordering has been computed, the Gurobi
Optimizer outputs information related to the barrier factor matrix:
<PRE>
Barrier statistics:
 AA' NZ     : 3.657e+04
 Factor NZ  : 8.450e+05 (roughly 12 MBytes of memory)
 Factor Ops : 3.944e+08 (less than 1 second per iteration)
 Threads    : 8
</PRE>
The First line shows the number of off-diagonal entries in the lower
triangle of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.18ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img274.svg"
 ALT="$AA^T$"></SPAN>.  A scaled version of this matrix is factored
in each iteration of the barrier algorithm, so the structure of the
Cholesky factor depends on the structure of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.18ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img274.svg"
 ALT="$AA^T$"></SPAN>.

<P>
The next two lines indicate the number of non-zero values in the
factor matrix, and the number of floating-point operations required to
factor it.  Note that the log also provides an estimate of how much
memory will be needed by the barrier algorithm, and how long each
barrier iteration will require: These are rough estimates that are
meant to provide a general sense of how difficult the model will be to
solve.  If you want to obtain an estimate of overall solution time,
note that most models achieve convergence in roughly 50 iterations,
but there are many exceptions.  Crossover runtime is typically
comparable to the cost of a few barrier iterations, but this time can
vary considerably, depending on the model characteristics.

<P>
The final line shows the number of threads that will be used
to perform the barrier iterations.

<P>
You may sometimes see two other lines in this section:
<PRE>
 Dense cols : 3
 Free vars  : 20
</PRE>
The first indicates how many columns from the constraint matrix were
treated as dense.  The second indicates how many variables in the
model are free.  Dense columns and free variables can sometimes lead
to numerical difficulties in the barrier solver, so it is useful to
know when they are present.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Progress Section</SPAN>

<P>
The third section of the Gurobi barrier output provides information
on the progress of the barrier method:
<PRE>
                  Objective                Residual
Iter       Primal          Dual         Primal    Dual     Compl     Time

   8   2.44764500e+08 -3.47987016e+08  1.47e-02 4.02e+02  6.46e+04     0s
   9   1.35906001e+08 -1.41063037e+08  7.16e-03 1.66e+02  3.01e+04     0s
  10   9.29132721e+07 -6.69973369e+07  4.58e-03 7.60e+01  1.73e+04     0s
</PRE>
The seven columns in each output row show the number of barrier
iterations performed to that point, the primal and dual objective
values for the current barrier iterate, the magnitude of the primal
and dual infeasibilities for the current iterate (computed as the
infinity-norms of the primal and dual residual vectors, respectively), the
magnitude of the complementarity violation of the current primal and
dual iterates (the dot product of the primal solution and the dual
reduced cost vector), and the amount of time expended to that point
(measured using wall clock time).  When the primal infeasibility, dual
infeasibility, and complementarity satisfy barrier convergence
tolerances (controlled using the
<A HREF="barconvtol.html#parameter:BarConvTol">BarConvTol</A> parameter), the
solution is declared optimal and optimization is complete.

<P>
Unlike the simplex and MIP optimizers, the barrier optimizer produces
a log line for each iterate, independent of the value of the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A> parameter.

<P>
You may sometimes see a star after the iteration count in the barrier
progress log:
<PRE>
  15   2.42800468e+03  8.54543324e+04  1.68e+02 1.02e-09  8.30e+04     0s
  16   4.05292006e+03  4.65997441e+04  1.82e+02 2.50e-01  4.25e+04     0s
  17*  4.88742259e+08  4.30781025e+10  5.17e+00 1.31e-01  2.52e-02     0s
  18*  1.21709951e+06  3.39471138e+13  8.55e-06 3.14e-06  3.14e-05     0s
  19* -1.38021972e+06  3.31580578e+16  3.42e-08 8.20e-09  3.22e-08     0s
  20*  1.25182178e+06  3.31575855e+19  6.54e-12 7.34e-09  3.22e-11     0s
</PRE>
This indicates that the model may be primal or dual infeasible.  Note
that these intermediate indications of infeasibility won't necessarily
turn into an infeasibility proof, so the star may disappear in later
iterations.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Crossover Section</SPAN>

<P>
The fourth section of the barrier log provides information on the
crossover step.  This section is only present when crossover is
selected (as controlled through the
<A HREF="crossover.html#parameter:Crossover">Crossover</A> parameter.
Crossover converts the interior point solution produced by the barrier
algorithm to a basic solution.

<P>
The first stage in crossover is to <EM>push</EM> variables to bounds in
order to obtain a valid basic solution.  By default, this is done for
dual variables first, then for primal variables.  Progress of this
phase is tracked with this portion of the crossover log...
<PRE>
Crossover log...

    1610 DPushes remaining with DInf 0.0000000e+00                 1s
       0 DPushes remaining with DInf 0.0000000e+00                 1s

     144 PPushes remaining with PInf 5.7124800e-03                 1s
       0 PPushes remaining with PInf 5.7124800e-03                 1s

  Push phase complete: Pinf 5.7124800e-03, Dinf 8.1488315e-07      1s
</PRE>
Each line indicates how many push steps remain, the amount of
infeasibility in the current solution, and the elapsed barrier time.

<P>
Upon completion of the push phase, crossover has a basic solution that
isn't necessarily optimal.  The resulting basis is passed to simplex,
and simplex completes the optimization...
<PRE>
Iteration    Objective       Primal Inf.    Dual Inf.      Time
    1700    1.1266352e+07   5.712480e-03   0.000000e+00      1s
    1868    1.1266393e+07   0.000000e+00   0.000000e+00      1s
</PRE>
The five columns in each output row of the simplex log show the number
of simplex iterations performed to that point in the crossover
algorithm (including the push steps), the objective value for the
current basis, the magnitude of the primal infeasibility for the
current basis (computed as the sum of the absolute values of all
constraint and bound violations), the magnitude of the dual
infeasibility (computed as the sum of the absolute values of all dual
constraint violations), and the amount of time expended by the
crossover algorithm to that point (measured using wall clock time).
When the primal and dual infeasibilities both reach zero, the basis is
optimal and optimization is complete.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Summary Section</SPAN>

<P>
The final section of the barrier log provides summary information.  It
provides a summary of the work that the barrier algorithm performed,
including the iteration count and the runtime, and it provides
information on outcome of the optimization.  The summary for a model
that is solved to optimality would look like this:
<PRE>
Solved in 1868 iterations and 1.05 seconds
Optimal objective  1.126639304e+07
</PRE>
Other termination states produce different summaries.  For example, a
user interrupt would produce a summary that looks like:
<PRE>
Stopped in 7482 iterations and 3.41 seconds
Solve interrupted
</PRE>
Hitting a time limit would produce a summary that looks like:
<PRE>
Stopped in 9221 iterations and 5.00 seconds
Time limit exceeded
</PRE>
