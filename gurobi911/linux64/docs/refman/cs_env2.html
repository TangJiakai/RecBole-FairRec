GRBEnv()
</H3>

<P>
Constructor for <code>GRBEnv</code> object.
You have the option of constructing either a local environment, which
solves Gurobi models on the local machine, a client environment for a
Gurobi compute server, which will solve Gurobi models on a server
machine, or an Instant Cloud environment, which will launch a Gurobi
Cloud server and solve models on that server.  Choose the appropriate
signature for the type of environment you wish to launch.

Create a Gurobi environment (with logging disabled).
This method will also populate any
parameter (<TT>ComputeServer</TT>, <TT>TokenServer</TT>,
<TT>ServerPassword</TT>, etc.) specified in your <TT>gurobi.lic</TT> file. This method will also check the current working directory for a file
named <TT>gurobi.env</TT>, and it will attempt to read
parameter settings from this file if it exists.  The file should
be in <A HREF="prm_format.html#format:PRM">PRM</A> format (briefly, each line
should contain a parameter name, followed by the desired value
for that parameter).

<P>
In general, you should aim to create a single Gurobi environment in
your program, even if you plan to work with multiple models.  Reusing
one environment is much more efficient than creating and destroying
multiple environments.  The one exception is if you are writing a
multi-threaded program, since environments are not thread safe.  In
this case, you will need a separate environment for each of your
threads.

parameter settings from this file if it exists.  The file should

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Arguments:</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">logFileName</SPAN>: The name of the log file for this environment.
  Pass an empty string for no log file.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">computeServer</SPAN>: A Compute Server.  You can refer to the server using its name or
its IP address.  If you are using a non-default port, the server
name should be followed by the port number (e.g.,
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">server1:61000</SPAN>)

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">router</SPAN>: The router for a Compute Server cluster.  A router can be used to
improve the robustness of a Compute Server deployment.  You
should refer to the router using either its name or its IP
address.  If no router is used (which is the typical case), pass
an empty string.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">password</SPAN>: The password for gaining access to the specified Compute Server
cluster.  Pass an empty string if no password is required.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">group</SPAN>: The name of the Compute Server group.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">CStlsInsecure</SPAN>: Indicates whether to use insecure mode in the TLS (Transport
Layer Security).  Set this to 0 unless your server administrator
tells you otherwise.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">priority</SPAN>: The priority of the job.  Priorities must be between -100 and
100, with a default value of 0 (by convention).  Higher priority
jobs are chosen from the server job queue before lower priority
jobs. Depending on the configuration of the
server, a job with priority 100 runs immediately, bypassing the
job queue and ignoring the job limit on the server. You should
exercise caution with priority 100 jobs, since they can severely
overload a server, which can cause jobs to fail, and in extreme
cases can cause the server to crash.  This behavior is managed by
the <TT>HARDJOBLIMIT</TT>, and is disabled by default. Refer
to the <A ID="tex2html17"
  HREF="../remoteservices/remoteservices.html">Gurobi Remote Services Reference
Manual</A>
for more
information on starting Compute Server options.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">timeout</SPAN>: Queue timeout (in seconds).  If the job doesn't reach the front of
the queue before the specified timeout, the call will exit with a
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">JOB_REJECTED</SPAN> error.  Use -1 to indicate
that the call should never timeout.

This method will also check the current working directory for a file

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">logfilename</SPAN>: The name of the log file for this environment.
  May be <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">NULL</SPAN> (or an empty string), in which case no log file is
  created.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">accessID</SPAN>: The access ID for your Gurobi Instant Cloud license.  This can be
retrieved from the Gurobi Instant Cloud website.  When used in
combination with your <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">secretKey</SPAN>, this allows you to launch
Instant Cloud instances and submit jobs to them.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">secretKey</SPAN>: The secret key for your Gurobi Instant Cloud license.  This can
be retrieved from the Gurobi Instant Cloud website.  When used in
combination with your <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">accessID</SPAN>, this allows you to launch
Instant Cloud instances and submit jobs to them.  Note that you
should keep your secret key private.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">pool</SPAN>: The machine pool.  Machine pools allow you to create fixed
configurations on the Instant Cloud website (capturing things
like type of machine, geographic region, etc.), and then launch
and share machines from client programs without having to
restart the configuration information each time you launch a
machine.  May be <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">NULL</SPAN> (or an empty string), in which case
your job will be launched in the default pool associated with
your cloud license.

<P>
 <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">priority</SPAN>: The priority of the job.  Priorities must be between -100 and
100, with a default value of 0 (by convention).  Higher priority
