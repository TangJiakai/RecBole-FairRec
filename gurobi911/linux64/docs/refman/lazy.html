<P>
Determines whether a linear constraint is treated as a <EM>lazy
constraint</EM> or a <EM>user cut</EM>.

<P>
At the beginning of the MIP solution process, any constraint
whose <code>Lazy</code> attribute is set to 1, 2, or 3 (the default value is
0) is treated as a lazy constraint; it is removed from the model and
placed in the lazy constraint pool.  Lazy constraints remain inactive
until a feasible solution is found, at which point the solution is
checked against the lazy constraint pool.  If the solution violates
any lazy constraints, the solution is discarded and one or more of the
violated lazy constraints are pulled into the active model.

<P>
Larger values for this attribute cause the constraint to be pulled
into the model more aggressively.  With a value of 1, the constraint
can be used to cut off a feasible solution, but it won't necessarily
be pulled in if another lazy constraint also cuts off the solution.
With a value of 2, all lazy constraints that are violated by a
feasible solution will be pulled into the model.  With a value of 3,
lazy constraints that cut off the relaxation solution at the root node
are also pulled in.

<P>
Any constraint whose Lazy attribute is set to -1 is treated as a user
cut; it is removed from the model and placed in the user cut
pool. User cuts may be added to the model at any node in the
branch-and-cut search tree to cut off relaxation solutions.

<P>
The main difference between user cuts and lazy constraints is that
that the former are not allowed to cut off integer-feasible solutions.
In other words, they are redundant for the MIP model, and the solver
is free to decide whether or not to use them to cut off relaxation
solutions.  The hope is that adding them speeds up the overall
solution process.  Lazy constraints have no such restrictions.  They
are essential to the model, and the solver is forced to apply them
whenever a solution would otherwise not satisfy them.

<P>
Note that deleting constraints from your model will cause this
attribute to be discarded.  If you'd like it to persist, your program
will need to repopulate it after deleting the constraints and making a
subsequent model update call.

<P>
Note that no corresponding attribute is available for other constraint
types (quadratic, SOS, or general constraints).  This attribute only
affects MIP models.
