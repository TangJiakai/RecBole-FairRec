Choosing the right algorithm</A>
</H3>

<P>
Gurobi Optimizer provides two main algorithms to solve continuous
models and the continuous relaxations of mixed-integer models: barrier
and simplex.

<P>
The barrier algorithm is usually fastest for large, difficult models.
However, it is also more numerically sensitive. And even
when the barrier algorithm converges, the crossover algorithm that
usually follows can stall due to numerical issues.

<P>
The simplex method is often a good alternative, since it is generally
less sensitive to numerical issues.  To use dual simplex or primal
simplex, set the <A HREF="method.html#parameter:Method">Method</A> parameter to
1 or 0, respectively.

<P>
Note that, in many optimization applications, not all problem
instances have numerical issues.  Thus, choosing simplex exclusively
may prevent you from taking advantage of the performance advantages of
the barrier algorithm on numerically well-behaved instances.  In such
cases, you should use the concurrent optimizer, which uses
multiple algorithms simultaneously and returns the solution from the
first one to finish.  The concurrent optimizer is the default
for LP models, and can be selected for MIP by setting
the <A HREF="method.html#parameter:Method">Method</A> parameter to 3 or 4.

<P>
For detailed control over the concurrent optimizer, you can create
concurrent environments, where you can set specific algorithmic
parameters for each concurrent solve. For example, you can create one
concurrent environment with <TT>Method=0</TT> and another with
<TT>Method=1</TT> to use primal and dual simplex simultaneously.
Finally, you can use concurrent optimization
with multiple distinct computers using distributed optimization.  On a
single computer, the different algorithms run on multiple threads,
each using different processor cores. With distributed optimization,
independent computers run the separate algorithms, which can be faster
since the computers do not compete for access to memory.

<P>
