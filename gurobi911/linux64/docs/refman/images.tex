A Compute Server.  You can refer to the server using its name or

\providecommand{\EnvargTimeout}{%
Queue timeout (in seconds).  If the job doesn't reach the front of

The priority of the job.  Priorities must be between -100 and
100, with a default value of 0 (by convention).  Higher priority
jobs are chosen from the server job queue before lower priority
jobs.\ Depending on the configuration of the
server, a job with priority 100 runs immediately, bypassing the
job queue and ignoring the job limit on the server. You should
exercise caution with priority 100 jobs, since they can severely
overload a server, which can cause jobs to fail, and in extreme
cases can cause the server to crash.  This behavior is managed by
the {\ttfamily HARDJOBLIMIT}, and is disabled by default. Refer

utilities installed (e.g., {\ttfamily 7z} or {\ttfamily zip} for Windows,
and {\ttfamily gzip}, {\ttfamily bzip2}, or {\ttfamily unzip} for
Linux or Mac OS), then the files can be compressed, so additional
suffixes of \texttt{.gz}, \texttt{.bz2}, or \texttt{.7z} are
accepted.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBgetJSONSolutionDescription}[2]{%
After a call to \hyperref{#1}{}{}{#2}, this method returns the
resulting solution and related model attributes as a JSON
string.  Please refer to the
\hyperref{JSON solution format}{}{}{format:JSON} section for details.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBoptimizebatchDescription}{%
Submit a new batch request to the Cluster Manager.
Returns the {\ttfamily BatchID} (a string), which
uniquely identifies the job in the Cluster Manager and
can be used to query the status of this request (from this
program or from any other).  Once the request has completed,
the \texttt{BatchID} can also be used to retrieve the associated
solution.  To submit a batch request, you must tag at
least one element of the model by setting one of the
\hyperref{VTag}{}{}{attr:VTag}, \hyperref{CTag}{}{}{attr:CTag} or
\hyperref{QCTag}{}{}{attr:QCTag} attributes. For more details on
batch optimization, please refer to the \hyperref{Batch
Optimization}{}{}{sec:BatchOptimization} section.


Note that this routine will process all pending model modifications.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBgetbatchDescription}[2]{%
  Given a {\ttfamily BatchID}, as returned by {#1}, and a Gurobi
  environment that can connect to the appropriate
  Cluster Manager (i.e., one where parameters
  \hyperref{CSManager}{}{}{parameter:CSManager},
  \hyperref{UserName}{}{}{parameter:UserName}, and
  \hyperref{ServerPassword}{}{}{parameter:ServerPassword}
  have been set appropriately), this function returns a {#2}.
  With it, you can query the current status
  of the associated batch request and, once the batch request has
  been processed, you can query its solution. Please refer to the
  \hyperref{Batch Optimization}{}{}{sec:BatchOptimization} section for
  details and examples.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBabortbatchDescription}[1]{%
This {#1}\ instructs the Cluster Manager to abort the processing of this
batch request, changing its status to
{\ttfamily ABORTED}.  Please refer to the \hyperref{Batch
Status Codes}{}{}{sec:BatchStatusCodes} section for further details.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBdiscardbatchDescription}[1]{%n
This {#1}\ instructs the Cluster Manager to remove all information
related to the batch request in question, including the stored
solution if available. Further queries for the associated batch
request will fail with error code {\ttfamily
GRB\_ERROR\_DATA\_NOT\_AVAILABLE}. Use this function with
care, as the removed information can not be recovered later on.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBretrybatchDescription}[1]{%
This {#1}\ instructs the Cluster Manager to retry optimization of a failed
or aborted batch request, changing its status to
{\ttfamily SUBMITTED}. Please refer to the \hyperref{Batch
Status Codes}{}{}{sec:BatchStatusCodes} section for further details.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBgetbatchjsonsolutionDescription}[1]{%
This {#1}\ retrieves the solution of a
completed batch request from a Cluster Manager. The solution is returned as a
\hyperref{JSON solution string}{}{}{format:JSON}. For this call to
succeed, the status of the batch request must be {\ttfamily COMPLETED}.
Please refer to the \hyperref{Batch Status
Codes}{}{}{sec:BatchStatusCodes} section for further details.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBwritebatchjsonsolutionDescription}[1]{%
This {#1}\ returns the stored solution of a completed
batch request from a Cluster Manager. The solution is returned in
a gzip-compressed JSON file. The file name you provide must end with a {\ttfamily
.json.gz} extension. The JSON format is described in the
\hyperref{JSON solution format}{}{}{format:JSON} section. Note that
for this call to succeed, the status of the batch request must be
{\ttfamily COMPLETED}. Please refer to the \hyperref{Batch
Status Codes}{}{}{sec:BatchStatusCodes} section for further details.} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBupdatebatchDescription}[1]{%
All Batch attribute values are cached locally, so queries
return the value received during the last communication with the
Cluster Manager.  This {#1}\ refreshes the values of all attributes with
the values currently available in the Cluster Manager (which involves
network communication).} 

%
\providecommand{\GRBbatchattrdetail}{%
Note that all Batch attributes are cached locally, and are only
updated when you create a client-side batch object or when you
explicitly update this cache (by calling the appropriate
{\ttfamily update} function -

\hyperref{update}{}{}{pythonmethod:Batch.update} for {\bf Python}, etc.).}

doing so may lead to undefined behavior.
