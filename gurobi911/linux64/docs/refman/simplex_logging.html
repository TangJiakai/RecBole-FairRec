Simplex Logging
</H2>

<P>
The simplex log can be divided into three sections: the presolve
section, the simplex progress section, and the summary section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Presolve Section</SPAN>

<P>
The first thing the Gurobi optimizer does when optimizing a model is
to apply a <EM>presolve</EM> algorithm in order to simplify the model.
The first section of the Gurobi log provides information on the extent
to which presolve succeeds in this effort.  Consider the following
example output from NETLIB model <code>dfl001</code>:
<PRE>
Presolve removed 2349 rows and 3378 columns
Presolve time: 0.04s
Presolved: 3722 rows, 8852 columns, 30908 nonzeros
</PRE>
The example output shows that presolve was able to remove 2349 rows
and 3378 columns, and it required 0.04 seconds.  The final line in the
presolve section shows the size of the model after presolve.  This is
size of the model that is passed to the simplex optimizer.  Note that
the solution that is computed for this model is automatically
transformed into a solution for the original problem once simplex
finishes (in a process often called <EM>uncrushing</EM>), but this
uncrush step is transparent and produces no log output.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Progress Section</SPAN>

<P>
The second section of the Gurobi simplex output provides information
on the progress of the simplex method:
<PRE>
Iteration    Objective       Primal Inf.    Dual Inf.      Time
       0   -2.4571000e+32   4.000000e+30   2.457100e+02      0s
   18420    1.1265574e+07   1.655263e+03   0.000000e+00      5s
   20370    1.1266393e+07   0.000000e+00   0.000000e+00      6s
</PRE>
The five columns in each output row show the number of simplex
iterations performed to that point, the objective value for the
current basis, the magnitude of the primal infeasibility for the
current basis (computed as the sum of the absolute values of all
constraint and bound violations), the magnitude of the dual
infeasibility (computed as the sum of the absolute values of all dual
constraint violations), and the amount of time expended to that point
(measured using wall clock time).  The default simplex algorithm in
the Gurobi solver is dual simplex, which tries to maintain dual
feasibility while performing simplex pivots to improve the objective.
Thus, once the dual simplex algorithm has found an initial dual
feasible basis, you will generally see a dual infeasibility value of
zero.  When the primal and dual infeasibilities both reach zero, the
basis is optimal and optimization is complete.

<P>
By default, the Gurobi optimizer produces a log line every 5 seconds.
The frequency of log lines can be changed by modifying the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A>
parameter (see the
<A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">Parameter</A> section of this document for
more information).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Summary Section</SPAN>

<P>
The third section of the simplex log provides summary information.  It
provides a summary of the work that the simplex algorithm performed,
including the iteration count and the runtime, and it provides
information on outcome of the optimization.  The summary for a model
that is solved to optimality would look like this:
<PRE>
Solved in 20370 iterations and 5.75 seconds
Optimal objective  1.126639304e+07
</PRE>
Other termination states produce different summaries.  For example, a
user interrupt would produce a summary that looks like:
<PRE>
Stopped in 7482 iterations and 3.41 seconds
Solve interrupted
</PRE>
Hitting a time limit would produce a summary that looks like:
<PRE>
Stopped in 18082 iterations and 5.00 seconds
Time limit reached
</PRE>
