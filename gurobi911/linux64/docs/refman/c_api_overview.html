C API Overview
</H1>

<P>
This section documents the Gurobi C interface.  This manual begins
with a quick overview of the functions in the interface, and continues
with <A HREF="c_api_details.html#sec:C-details">detailed descriptions of all of the available interface
  routines</A>.

<P>
If you are new to the Gurobi Optimizer, we suggest that you start with
the
<A ID="tex2html5"
  HREF="../quickstart_windows/index.html">Quick Start Guide</A>
or the
<A ID="tex2html6"
  HREF="../examples/examples.html">Example Tour</A>.
These
documents provide concrete examples of how to use the routines
described here.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Environments</SPAN>

<P>
The first step in using the Gurobi C optimizer is to create an
environment, using the <A HREF="c_loadenv.html#routine:GRBloadenv">GRBloadenv</A>
call.  The environment acts as a container for all data associated
with a set of optimization runs.  You will generally only need one
environment in your program, even if you wish to work with multiple
optimization models.  Once you are done with an environment, you
should call <A HREF="c_freeenv.html#routine:GRBfreeenv">GRBfreeenv</A> to release
the associated resources.

<P>
For more advanced use cases, you can use the
<A HREF="c_emptyenv.html#routine:GRBemptyenv">GRBemptyenv</A> routine to create
an uninitialized environment and then, programmatically, set all
required options for your specific requirements. For further details
see the <A HREF="environments.html#sec:Environment">Environment</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Models</SPAN>

<P>
You can create one or more optimization models within an environment.
A model consists of a set of variables, a linear, quadratic, or
piecewise-linear objective function on those variables, and a set of
constraints.  Each variable has an associated lower bound, upper
bound, type (continuous, binary, integer, semi-continuous, or
semi-integer), and linear objective coefficient.  Each linear
constraint has an associated sense (less-than-or-equal,
greater-than-or-equal, or equal), and right-hand side value.  Refer to
<A HREF="variables_and_constraints_.html#sec:VarsConstraintsObjectives">this section</A> for more
information on variables and constraints.

<P>
An optimization model may be specified all at once, through the
<A HREF="c_loadmodel.html#routine:GRBloadmodel">GRBloadmodel</A> routine, or built
incrementally, by first calling
<A HREF="c_newmodel.html#routine:GRBnewmodel">GRBnewmodel</A> and then calling
<A HREF="c_addvars.html#routine:GRBaddvars">GRBaddvars</A> to add variables and
<A HREF="c_addconstr.html#routine:GRBaddconstr">GRBaddconstr</A>,
<A HREF="c_addqconstr.html#routine:GRBaddqconstr">GRBaddqconstr</A>,
<A HREF="c_addsos.html#routine:GRBaddsos">GRBaddsos</A>, or any of the
<A HREF="c_agc_xxx.html#routine:GRBaddgenconstrXxx">GRBaddgenconstrXxx</A> methods to add
constraints. Models are dynamic entities; you can always add or delete
variables or constraints.

<P>
Specific variables and constraints are referred to throughout the
Gurobi C interface using their indices.  Variable indices are assigned
as variables are added to the model, in a contiguous fashion.  The
same is true for constraints.  In adherence to C language conventions,
indices all start at 0.

<P>
We often refer to the <EM>class</EM> of an optimization model.  A
model with a linear objective function, linear constraints, and
continuous variables is a <EM>Linear Program (LP)</EM>.  If the
objective is quadratic, the model is a <EM>Quadratic Program
(QP)</EM>.  If any of the constraints are quadratic, the model is a
<EM>Quadratically-Constrained Program (QCP)</EM>.  We will
sometimes refer to a few special cases of QCP:
QCPs with convex constraints,
QCPs with non-convex constraints,
<EM>bilinear programs</EM>,
and <EM>Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCP)</EM>.
If the model contains any integer variables,
semi-continuous variables, semi-integer variables, Special Ordered Set
(SOS) constraints, or general constraints, the model is a
<EM>Mixed Integer Program (MIP)</EM>.  We'll also sometimes discuss
special cases of MIP, including <EM>Mixed Integer Linear Programs
(MILP)</EM>, <EM>Mixed Integer Quadratic Programs (MIQP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programs (MIQCP)</EM>, and
<EM>Mixed Integer Second-Order Cone Programs (MISOCP)</EM>.  The
Gurobi Optimizer handles all of these model classes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Solving a Model</SPAN>

<P>
Once you have built a model, you can call
<A HREF="c_optimize.html#routine:GRBoptimize">GRBoptimize</A> to compute a solution.
By default, <code>GRBoptimize()</code> will use the
<A HREF="concurrent_optimizer.html#sec:Concurrent">concurrent optimizer</A>
to solve LP models, the barrier algorithm to solve QP models
with convex objectives and
QCP models with convex constraints,
and the branch-and-cut algorithm otherwise.
The solution is stored as a set of
<EM>attributes</EM> of the model.  The C interface contains an extensive
set of routines for querying these attributes.

<P>
The Gurobi algorithms keep careful track of the state of the model,
so calls to <code>GRBoptimize()</code> will only perform further
optimization if relevant data has changed since the model was last
optimized.  If you would like to discard previously computed solution
information and restart the optimization from scratch without changing
the model, you can call
<A HREF="c_reset.html#routine:GRBreset">GRBreset</A>.

<P>
After a MIP model has been solved, you can call
<A HREF="c_fixmodel.html#routine:GRBfixmodel">GRBfixmodel</A> to compute the
associated <EM>fixed</EM> model.  This model is identical to the
original, except that the integer variables are fixed to their values
in the MIP solution.  If your model contains SOS constraints, some
continuous variables that appear in these constraints may be fixed as
well.  In some applications, it can be useful to compute information
on this fixed model (e.g., dual variables, sensitivity information,
etc.), although you should be careful in how you interpret this
information.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Multiple Solutions, Objectives, and Scenarios</SPAN>

<P>
By default, the Gurobi Optimizer assumes that your goal is to find one
proven optimal solution to a single model with a single objective
function.  Gurobi provides the following features that allow you to
relax these assumptions:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="solution_pool.html#sec:SolutionPool">Solution Pool</A>: Allows you to
  find more solutions.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="multiple_scenarios.html#sec:MultipleScenarios">Multiple Scenarios</A>: Allows
  you to find solutions to multiple, related models.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="multiple_objectives.html#sec:MultipleObjectives">Multiple Objectives</A>: Allows
  you to specify multiple objective functions and control the
  trade-off between them.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Infeasible Models</SPAN>

<P>
You have a few options if a model is found to be infeasible.  You can
try to diagnose the cause of the infeasibility, attempt to repair the
infeasibility, or both.  To obtain information that can be useful for
diagnosing the cause of an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="c_computeiis.html#routine:GRBcomputeIIS">GRBcomputeIIS</A> to compute an
Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS).  This routine can be used
for both continuous and MIP models, but you should be aware that the
MIP version can be quite expensive.  This routine populates a set of
IIS attributes.

<P>
To attempt to repair an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="c_feasrelax.html#routine:GRBfeasrelax">GRBfeasrelax</A> to compute a
feasibility relaxation for the model.  This relaxation allows you to
find a solution that minimizes the magnitude of the constraint
violation.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying and Modifying Attributes</SPAN>

<P>
Most of the information associated with a Gurobi model is stored in a
set of attributes.  Some attributes are associated with the variables
of the model, some with the constraints of the model, and some with
the model itself.  To give a simple example, solving an optimization
model causes the <code>X</code> variable attribute to be populated.
Attributes such as <code>X</code> that are computed by the Gurobi optimizer
cannot be modified directly by the user, while others, such as the
variable lower bound array (the <code>LB</code> attribute) can.

<P>
The Gurobi C interface contains an extensive set of routines for
querying or modifying attribute values.  The exact routine to use for
a particular attribute depends on the type of the attribute.  As
mentioned earlier, attributes can be either variable attributes,
constraint attributes, or model attributes.  Variable and constraint
attributes are arrays, and use a set of array attribute routines.
Model attributes are scalars, and use a set of scalar routines.
Attribute values can additionally be of type <EM>char</EM>,
<EM>int</EM>, <EM>double</EM>, or <EM>string</EM> (really <EM>char *</EM>).

<P>
Scalar model attributes are accessed through a set of
<code>GRBget*attr()</code> routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="c_getintattr.html#routine:GRBgetintattr">GRBgetintattr</A>).  In addition,
those model attributes that can be set directly by the user (e.g., the
objective sense) may be modified through the <code>GRBset*attr()</code>
routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="c_setdblattr.html#routine:GRBsetdblattr">GRBsetdblattr</A>).

<P>
Array attributes are accessed through three sets of routines.  The
first set, the <code>GRBget*attrarray()</code> routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="c_getcharattrarray.html#routine:GRBgetcharattrarray">GRBgetcharattrarray</A>)
return a contiguous sub-array of the attribute array, specified using
the index of the first member and the length of the desired sub-array.
The second set, the <code>GRBget*attrelement()</code> routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="c_getcharattrelement.html#routine:GRBgetcharattrelement">GRBgetcharattrelement</A>)
return a single entry from the attribute array.  Finally, the
<code>GRBget*attrlist()</code> routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="c_getdblattrlist.html#routine:GRBgetdblattrlist">GRBgetdblattrlist</A>) retrieve
attribute values for a list of indices.

<P>
Array attributes that can be set by the user are modified through the
<code>GRBset*attrarray()</code>, <code>GRBset*attrelement()</code>, and
<code>GRBset*attrlist()</code> routines.

<P>
The full list of Gurobi attributes can be found in the
<A HREF="attributes.html#sec:Attributes">Attributes</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Additional Model Modification Information</SPAN>

<P>
Most modifications to an existing model are done through the attribute
interface (e.g., changes to variable bounds, constraint right-hand
sides, etc.).  The main exceptions are modifications to the
constraints themselves, and to the quadratic and piecewise-linear
portions of the objective function.

<P>
The constraint matrix can be modified in a few ways.  The first is to
call <A HREF="c_chgcoeffs.html#routine:GRBchgcoeffs">GRBchgcoeffs</A> to change
individual matrix coefficients.  This routine can be used to modify
the value of an existing non-zero, to set an existing non-zero to
zero, or to create a new non-zero.  The constraint matrix is also
modified when you remove constraints (through
<A HREF="c_delconstrs.html#routine:GRBdelconstrs">GRBdelconstrs</A>) or variables
(through <A HREF="c_delvars.html#routine:GRBdelvars">GRBdelvars</A>).  The non-zero
values associated with the deleted constraints or variables are
removed along with the constraints or variables themselves.

<P>
Quadratic objective terms are added to the objective function using the
<A HREF="c_addqpterms.html#routine:GRBaddqpterms">GRBaddqpterms</A> routine.  You can
add a list of quadratic terms in one call, or you can add terms
incrementally through multiple calls.  The
<A HREF="c_delq.html#routine:GRBdelq">GRBdelq</A> routine allows you to delete
all quadratic terms from the model.  Note that quadratic models will
typically have both quadratic and linear terms.  Linear terms are
entered and modified through the <code>Obj</code> attribute, in the same
way that they are handled for models with purely linear objective
functions.

<P>
If your variables have piecewise-linear objectives, you can specify
them using the <A HREF="c_setpwlobj.html#routine:GRBsetpwlobj">GRBsetpwlobj</A>
routine.  Call this routine once for each relevant variable.  The
Gurobi simplex solver includes algorithmic support for convex
piecewise-linear objective functions, so for continuous models you
should see a substantial performance benefit from using this feature.
To clear a previously specified piecewise-linear objective function,
simply set the <code>Obj</code> attribute on the corresponding variable to
0.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lazy Updates</SPAN>

<P>
One important item to note about model modification in the Gurobi
optimizer is that it is performed in a <EM>lazy</EM> fashion, meaning
that modifications don't affect the model immediately.  Rather, they
are queued and applied later.  If your program simply creates a model
and solves it, you will probably never notice this behavior.  However,
if you ask for information about the model before your modifications
have been applied, the details of the lazy update approach may be
relevant to you.

<P>
As we just noted, model modifications (bound changes, right-hand side
changes, objective changes, etc.) are placed in a queue.  These queued
modifications can be applied to the model in three different ways.
The first is by an explicit call to
<A HREF="c_updatemodel.html#routine:GRBupdatemodel">GRBupdatemodel</A>.  The second is
by a call to <A HREF="c_optimize.html#routine:GRBoptimize">GRBoptimize</A>.  The
third is by a call to <A HREF="c_write.html#routine:GRBwrite">GRBwrite</A> to
write out the model.  The first case gives you fine-grained control
over when modifications are applied.  The second and third make the
assumption that you want all pending modifications to be applied
before you optimize your model or write it to disk.

<P>
Why does the Gurobi interface behave in this manner?  There are a few
reasons.  The first is that this approach makes it much easier to
perform multiple modifications to a model, since the model remains
unchanged between modifications.  The second is that processing model
modifications can be expensive, particularly in a Compute Server
environment, where modifications require communication between
machines.  Thus, it is useful to have visibility into exactly when
these modifications are applied.  In general, if your program needs to
make multiple modifications to the model, you should aim to make them
in phases, where you make a set of modifications, then update, then
make more modifications, then update again, etc.  Updating after each
individual modification can be extremely expensive.

<P>
If you forget to call update, your program won't crash.  Your query
will simply return the value of the requested data from the point of
the last update.  If the object you tried to query didn't exist then,
you'll get an <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE</SPAN> error instead.

<P>
The semantics of lazy updates have changed since earlier Gurobi
versions.  While the vast majority of programs are unaffected by this
change, you can use the <A HREF="updatemode.html#parameter:UpdateMode">UpdateMode</A>
parameter to revert to the earlier behavior if you run into an issue.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Managing Parameters</SPAN>

<P>
The Gurobi optimizer provides a set of parameters that allow you to
control many of the details of the optimization process.  Factors like
feasibility and optimality tolerances, choices of algorithms,
strategies for exploring the MIP search tree, etc., can be controlled
by modifying Gurobi parameters before beginning the optimization.
Parameters are set using the <code>GRBset*param()</code> routines (e.g.,
<A HREF="c_setintparam.html#routine:GRBsetintparam">GRBsetintparam</A>).  Current
values can be retrieved with the <code>GRBget*param()</code> routines
(e.g., <A HREF="c_getdblparam.html#routine:GRBgetdblparam">GRBgetdblparam</A>).
Parameters can be of type <EM>int</EM>, <EM>double</EM>, or <EM>char
  *</EM> (string).  You can also read a set of parameter settings from a
file using <A HREF="c_readparams.html#routine:GRBreadparams">GRBreadparams</A>, or
write the set of changed parameters using
<A HREF="c_writeparams.html#routine:GRBwriteparams">GRBwriteparams</A>.

<P>
We also include an automated parameter tuning tool that explores many
different sets of parameter changes in order to find a set that
improves performance.  You can call
<A HREF="c_tunemodel.html#routine:GRBtunemodel">GRBtunemodel</A>
to invoke the tuning tool on a model.
Refer to the
<A HREF="parameter_tuning_tool.html#sec:Tuning">parameter tuning tool</A>
section for more information.

<P>
One thing we should note is that each model gets its own copy of the
environment when it is created.  Parameter changes to the original
environment therefore have no effect on existing models.  Use
<A HREF="c_getenv.html#routine:GRBgetenv">GRBgetenv</A> to retrieve the
environment associated with a particular model if you want to change a
parameter for that model.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Monitoring Progress - Logging and Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Progress of the optimization can be monitored through Gurobi logging.
By default, Gurobi will send output to the screen.  A few simple
controls are available for modifying the default logging behavior.  If
you would like to direct output to a file as well as to the screen,
specify the log file name in
<A HREF="c_loadenv.html#routine:GRBloadenv">GRBloadenv</A> when you create your
environment.  You can modify the
<A HREF="logfile.html#parameter:LogFile">LogFile</A>
parameter if you
wish to redirect the log to a different file after creating the
environment.  The frequency of logging output can be controlled with
the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A>
parameter, and logging can be turned off
entirely with the
<A HREF="outputflag.html#parameter:OutputFlag">OutputFlag</A>
parameter.  A detailed
description of the Gurobi log file can be found in the
<A HREF="logging.html#sec:Logging">Logging</A> section.

<P>
More detailed progress monitoring can be done through the Gurobi
callback function.  The
<A HREF="c_setcb_func.html#routine:GRBsetcallbackfunc">GRBsetcallbackfunc</A>
routine allows you to install a function that the Gurobi optimizer
will call regularly during the optimization process.  You can call
<A HREF="c_cbget.html#routine:GRBcbget">GRBcbget</A> from within the callback
to obtain additional information about the state of the optimization.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modifying Solver Behavior - Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Callbacks can also be used to modify the behavior of the Gurobi
optimizer.  If you call routine
<A HREF="c_terminate.html#routine:GRBterminate">GRBterminate</A> from within a
callback, for example, the optimizer will terminate at the earliest
convenient point.  Routine
<A HREF="c_cbsolution.html#routine:GRBcbsolution">GRBcbsolution</A> allows you to
inject a feasible solution (or partial solution) during the solution
of a MIP model.  Routines <A HREF="c_cbcut.html#routine:GRBcbcut">GRBcbcut</A>
and <A HREF="c_cblazy.html#routine:GRBcblazy">GRBcblazy</A>
allow you to add <EM>cutting planes</EM> and <EM>lazy constraints</EM>
during a MIP optimization, respectively.
Routine
<A HREF="c_cbstoponemultiobj.html#routine:GRBcbstoponemultiobj">GRBcbstoponemultiobj</A>
allows you to interrupt the optimization process of one of the optimization steps in
a multi-objective MIP problem without stopping the hierarchical
optimization process.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Batch Optimization</SPAN>

<P>
Gurobi Compute Server enables programs to offload
  optimization computations onto dedicated servers.
  The Gurobi Cluster Manager adds a number of additional
  capabilities on top of this.  One important one,
  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">batch optimization</SPAN>, allows you to build an
  optimization model with your client program,
  submit it to a Compute Server cluster (through the Cluster
  Manager), and later check on the status of the model
  and retrieve its solution.  You can use a
  <A HREF="c_getbatch.html#routine:GRBgetbatch">Batch object</A> to make it easier to
  work with batches.
  For details on batches, please refer to the
  <A HREF="batch_optimization.html#sec:BatchOptimization">Batch Optimization</A>
  section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Error Handling</SPAN>

<P>
Most of the Gurobi C library routines return an integer error code.  A
zero return value indicates that the routine completed successfully,
while a non-zero value indicates that an error occurred.  The list of
possible error return codes can be found in the <A HREF="error_codes.html#sec:ErrorCodes">Error
  Codes</A> section.

<P>
When an error occurs, additional information on the error can be
obtained by calling
<A HREF="c_geterrormsg.html#routine:GRBgeterrormsg">GRBgeterrormsg</A>.
