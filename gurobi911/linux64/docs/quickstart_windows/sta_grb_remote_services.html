Starting Gurobi Remote Services
</H2>

<P>
<B>Important note: you only need to start Gurobi Remote Services if
you are setting up a Compute Server or a distributed worker (for use
in distributed algorithms).  If you are not sure whether you need to
start Gurobi Remote Services, you can examine the contents of your
<code>gurobi.lic</code> file.  If it contains the line <code>CSENABLED=1</code>,
then you need Gurobi Remote Services.  If it contains a line that
begins with <code>DISTRIBUTED=</code>, and if you plan to run distributed
algorithms, then you also need Gurobi Remote Services.</B>

<P>
Gurobi Remote Services is a
Windows Service that allows one or more machines to perform
Gurobi computations on behalf of other client machines.  The set of
services a server can provide will depend on your license.  If you are
setting up a machine as a distributed worker, no license is required.
In this case, the only service provided by the server is to act as a
worker in a distributed algorithm.  If you have a Compute Server
license, then servers running Gurobi Remote Services can provide a
variety of services, including offloading computation from a set of
clients, balancing computational load among the servers, and providing
failover capabilities, in addition to acting as a distributed worker.
In this case, be sure that your license key file has been installed
before starting Gurobi Remote Services.

<P>
You'll find instructions for installing, starting, and stopping
Gurobi Remote Services in the
<EM>Cluster Setup and Administration</EM>
section of the
<A ID="tex2html21"
  HREF="../remoteservices/remoteservices.html">Gurobi Remote Services Reference Manual</A>.

<P>
Note that Gurobi Remote Services is distributed as a separate
installer (named
gurobi_server9.1.0.msi
on the
Windows platform).
You'll need to download that file separately from
<A ID="tex2html22"
  HREF="https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer">our download page</A>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Next steps</SPAN>

<P>
Once you've set up Gurobi Remote Services, you should test
the state of the server.  Type this command on your server
(assuming you have configured your Compute Server to use port 61000):

<PRE>
gurobi_cl --server=localhost:61000
</PRE>
If the output includes the following line:

<PRE>
Capacity available on 'localhost:61000' - connecting...
</PRE>
then Remote Services is ready for use.

<P>
Client programs will need to know how to reach your server.
If you are using Gurobi Compute Server, this is typically done with a
<A HREF="creating_a_compute_server_.html#subsection:clientlicensecompute">client license file</A>.
You should set that up now.
