Retrieving a Compute Server license
</H3>

<P>
If you have purchased one or more Gurobi Compute Server licenses,
you'll need to perform a few setup steps in order to start your
Compute Servers.  Once started, client machines will be able to
offload the work of solving an optimization model onto these servers.
The clients and the Compute Servers can run any mix of supported
operating systems.  Thus, for example, multiple
Linux
machines could
submit jobs to a pair of Compute Servers, one running Windows and the
other running
Linux.
Any machine that can reach the Compute Server(s)
over your network can be a client (including the Compute Servers
themselves).

<P>
Once you've chosen a machine to act as a Compute Server (or a node in
a Compute Server cluster), you'll need to run the <TT>grbgetkey</TT>
  command on your machine to retrieve your Gurobi license key. Note
  that the machine must be connected to the Internet in order to run
  this command. An Internet connection is not required after you have
  obtained your license key.

<P>
If your computer isn't connected to the
  Internet or if your network security system does not allow the
  command below to function, we also offer a manual license key
  process.  You'll find manual instructions at the bottom of the
  License Details page for your license (which can be found by visiting
  <A ID="tex2html17"
  HREF="https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses">Current Gurobi Licenses</A>
and clicking on the appropriate <EM>License ID</EM>).

<P>
The exact
command to run for a specific license is indicated at the bottom
of the License Details page (e.g., <code>grbgetkey 253e22f3-...</code>). We
recommend that you use copy-paste to copy the entire <code>grbgetkey</code>
command from our website and paste it
directly into the Windows
<EM>Search</EM> box (and then hit <EM>Enter</EM>):

</DIV>
If you are unfamiliar with running command-line commands on a Windows
system, you can learn more
<A HREF="windows_command_line.html#section:windowscommandline">here</A>.

<P>
The <code>grbgetkey</code> program passes identifying information about
your machine back to our website, and the website responds with your
license key.  Once this exchange has occurred, <code>grbgetkey</code> will
ask for the name of the directory in which to store your license
key file (<code>gurobi.lic</code>).  You should see a prompt that looks
like this:

<P>
<P>
<TT>Gurobi license key client (version 9.1.0)
<BR>

<P>
<TT>Key for license ID 146542 was successfully retrieved.

<P>
<TT>In which folder would you like to store the Gurobi license key file?
<BR>[hit Enter to store it in c:&#92;gurobi]:
<BR></TT>
<P>
<TT>-&gt; License key saved to file 'c:&#92;gurobi&#92;gurobi.lic'.
<BR></TT>

<P>
You can store the license key file anywhere, but we strongly recommend
that you accept the default location (either your home directory or <TT>    c:&#92;gurobi</TT>) by
hitting <EM>Enter</EM>. Setting up a non-default location is
error-prone and a frequent source of trouble.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Using a non-default license file location</SPAN>

<P>
When you run the Windows version of the
Gurobi Optimizer, it will look for the <code>gurobi.lic</code> key file in
three different default locations: <TT>c:&#92;gurobi</TT>,
<TT>c:&#92;gurobi910</TT> (for Gurobi
9.1.0), and your home directory.  Note that these default paths
are absolute, so for example Gurobi will look for the license key file
in <TT>c:&#92;gurobi</TT>, even if the software is
installed in <TT>d:&#92;gurobi</TT>.  Note that the token
server won't look for the license file in your home directory (it runs
under username <EM>LocalService</EM>, so it doesn't have access to your
home directory).

If you would like to use a non-default license key file location, you
can do so by setting a <EM>system</EM>
environment variable <code>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</code> to point to the license
key file. See <A HREF="setting_environment_variab.html#subsection:setenvvars">Setting environment
variables</A> for details on how to do this.

<P>
<EM>Important note: the environment variable should point to the
license key file itself, not to the directory that contains the file.</EM>

<P>
Once you have followed the steps above and have obtained
a license key file, your next step is to
<A HREF="sta_grb_remote_services.html#subsection:startremoteservices">start Gurobi Remote Services</A>.
